 * Simulation Loop:
   * Time Step: Implement a time step mechanism to update the simulation state at regular intervals.
   * Agent Actions: Allow agents to take actions within the environment, such as moving, interacting with objects, or communicating with other agents.
   * Environment Update: Update the environment state based on agent actions and physical simulations.
   * Reward and Punishment: Assign rewards or punishments to agents based on their performance.
 * Data Collection and Analysis:
   * Logging: Log agent actions, environment states, and rewards for analysis.
